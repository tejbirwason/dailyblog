I have always been fascinated with people that write everyday.

It is one of those things that on the surface seem like it is easy to do, but I have tried and consistently failed. 

I believe I have finally gotten over the fear to publish something under my name, so here it goes.

This blog will probably evolve as we go, but it will be pretty wide ranging. The goal is to publish every single day and never break the chain!
