Warren Buffett has a famous 5-25 Rule regarding focus, write down your top 25 goals. Then choose the top 5 and toss the other 20 into the 'avoid at all cost' pile.

The idea here is to never tangentially work on a goal. You will need to dedicate all your effort and energy to the top 5 to achieve any semblance of success.

When you are young and have the capability to spot good opportunities, a lot of your energy can get lost chasing multiple ideas at once, barely making progress on any single one. All returns, however, come from going deep into a subject at a time rather than spreading yourself too thin.

The biggest benefit of serving this rule is that it simplifies your day, and gets rid of an immense amount of decision fatigue. For instance, these are the five that made the top of my list:

1. Become a better writer
2. Create an online business
3. Read a lot
4. Get fit
5. Productize myself (ala Naval)

Having these top priorities helps structure the day for me the day I would like most. I wake up and immediately do a high-intensity workout, followed by writing in my nook and the first reading of the day. Then after my workday is complete, it's straight to work on my online business, the learnings of which I share on this blog and Twitter, as part of productizing myself.
