Warren Buffett has a famous 5-25 Rule regarding focus, write down your top 25 goals. Then choose the top 5 and toss the other 20 into the 'avoid at all cost' pile.

The idea here is to never tangentially work on a goal. You will need to dedicate all your effort and energy to the top 5 to achieve any semblance of success.

When you are young and have the capability to spot good opportunities, a lot of your energy can get lost chasing multiple ideas at once, barely making progress on any single one. All returns, however, come from going deep into a subject at a time rather than spreading yourself too thin.
